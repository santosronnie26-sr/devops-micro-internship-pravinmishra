# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer performs straightforward pattern matching and resource inventory tasks. It scans Terraform files for known cost patterns (like CloudFront price classes or S3 storage tiers) and delivers structured recommendations. This task has clear criteria and doesn't require nuanced reasoning across multiple competing factors, making Haiku's speed and efficiency better suited than Sonnet's deeper reasoning capabilities. The trade-off favors cost and latency over analytical depth.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security auditor is a read-only inspection tool. By excluding Write, it cannot accidentally or intentionally modify infrastructure files, creating an audit-proof boundary between analysis and execution. This enforces a security principle: the mechanism that detects problems should be separate from the mechanism that fixes them, preventing a single compromised agent from both identifying and patching vulnerabilities.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

The tf-writer generates and modifies live infrastructure code, so it must adapt to the parent context's model selection. Using inherit ensures consistency with Claude Code's default reasoning capability rather than forcing a fixed model that might be misaligned with the project's requirements. This allows the project to upgrade or adjust its base model without updating individual agent definitions.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
